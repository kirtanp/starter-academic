This framework will enable users to easily create, train, test and deploy deep learning models with a focus on multi-objective. The framework is easy to use and understand. It is developed in "Lego fashion", meaning that we already supply out of the box models, loss function, metrics which can be easily used to build and train models, but also we leave full flexibility to the user to define their own models, losses, metrics only by implementing abstract classes.
