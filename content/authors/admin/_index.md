I am  PhD candidate at Helmholtz AI in Munich, advised by [Niki Kilbertus](https://sites.google.com/view/nikikilbertus). I have two primary themes of interest. (1) Questions at the intersection of causality and machine learning. In particular how we can make meaningful causal inferences without making prohibitively strong assumptions. I am also interested in the connections of causality to experimental design. (2) I am passionate about questions related to the ethical implications of AI, and particularly how we can have better regulations to take the good and avoid the bad that comes out of rapid progress in the field.
